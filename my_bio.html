	More about me...
</h3>

<h4>
<p>
	Electrical Engineering student with industry experience in circuit design, computer vision, hardware product prototyping, python, C# and C++.
</p>
<p>
I have a wide skill set, so that I can solve problems creatively and efficiently. During my internship at SMS Group, I designed and implemented an outdoor real time asset management system. The PCB board and visualization software I implemented greatly simplified prototyping and testing procedures. I also played important roles in testing long range wireless module and implementing the Modbus protocol on micro controller. 
</p>
<p>
During the previous summer, I worked on direct ink writing 3D printer in Architected Materials Lab at UPenn. As a research assistant to Prof. Jordan Raney, I designed 3D printer auger extruder for printing poly-dimenthyl-siloxane (PDMS) paste.
</p>
<p>
In the semester, I have a leadership role as Biosphere freshman residential program manager in Kings Court English College House (KCECH). As a community builder for a floor of 40+ freshmen, an event organizer for a house of 350+ residents, and a member of the house management team, I have great communication skills and leadership abilities.
</p>
<p>
In the upcoming years as a student and engineer, I hope to work in more close-knit teams as a contributor of ideas and as a leader in innovation. I am sure my presence can always benefit the people around me.
